# Timber Integration for WooCommerce

## 0.5.2

- Fixed bug that prevented the integration from working with different versions of Twig. Thanks @chrislind and @VincentLoy!
- Removed non-working support for installing the integration as a WordPress plugin. The integration can only be installed through Composer. Future versions of Timber will will drop support for installation as a plugin. Thatâ€™s why drop it here, too.

## 0.5.1

- Improved default templates.
- Improved documentation.
